This short exercise is meant to simulate some of the day to day work we do at pwinty. There are a number of tasks, intended to cater
for a wide range of candidates. Don't worry if you can't do any of it- and feel free to ask for help.

To submit- please make a fork of this Git repo, commit and push your changes, and then share the repo with @tomgallard. 

Please use a seperate commit for each task. Add any notes/comments to the bottom of this file

0.) Prerequisites- this is best run in Visual Studio community edition. Should work on either Mac or PC
1.) Open the solution file and run the console app. Observe it writes an ARGB (Alpha, Red, Green, Blue) value to the console

Task 1:
Complete the code in the CalculateAverageColour function in ImageChecker.cs to calculate the average colour of the supplied image. Use your
judgement as to what 'average' to use (mean, mode, median).

Task 2:
Think about how the performance of this function would change for a larger image. What could you do to make it faster? What 
tradeoffs would be involved? Update the code with your new approach

Task 3 (advanced):
???
